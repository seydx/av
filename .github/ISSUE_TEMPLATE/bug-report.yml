        Hi. Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report!

        Before we start, be sure you are aware of the following points:
        - Check if your issue is already reported in the existing issues
        - The NodeAV binaries include all necessary FFmpeg libraries - no separate FFmpeg installation needed
        - For segmentation faults, please include a full stack trace if possible
        - If you're building from source, FFmpeg 7.1+ headers are required
