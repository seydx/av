/**
 * Custom I/O Demuxing Example
 *
 * This example will demonstrate how to use custom I/O callbacks for demuxing,
 * allowing you to read from custom sources like memory, network streams,
 * or encrypted files instead of regular files.
 *
 * Use cases:
 * - Reading from memory buffers
 * - Reading from network streams
 * - Reading encrypted content
 * - Custom protocols
 * - Progressive download/streaming
 *
 * TODO: Custom IOContext callbacks are not yet implemented in the bindings.
 * This requires adding support for custom read/write/seek callbacks in IOContext.
 *
 * The API would look something like:
 * ```typescript
 * const ioContext = new IOContext();
 * await ioContext.openCustom(
 *   bufferSize,
 *   flags,
 *   readCallback,
 *   seekCallback,
 *   writeCallback
 * );
 * ```
